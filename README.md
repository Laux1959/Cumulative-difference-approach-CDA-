# Cumulative-difference-approach-CDA-
 This Python code uses the Cumulative Difference Approach to segment highways from spreadsheet data, identifying key points for targeted maintenance and improvements.
 
 This Python code is designed to analyze highway data provided in a spreadsheet. The core functionality of the code is to segment the highway into homogeneous sub-sections using the Cumulative Difference Approach (CDA), utilizing data such as pavement condition and other relevant parameters. Initially, the code reads data from the spreadsheet, which includes information such as pavement condition and other relevant parameters. The CDA algorithm is then applied to identify points where the highway properties, such as pavement condition, change significantly. This approach involves calculating cumulative differences in these properties along the highway and identifying points where these differences exceed a predefined threshold. These points are used to define the boundaries of the homogeneous subsections. The result is a detailed segmentation of the highway, enabling more precise analysis and decision-making for maintenance and improvements, by providing insights into specific areas that require attention.
